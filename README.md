Project Euler problems are challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require skills of both mathematician and programmer to solve most problems. All of these problems are published on this website: https://projecteuler.net/

I solved just  some of them to test  and improve my mathematical and computational skills.

I checked all of my answers by comparing it with answers of other programmers on the Internet.
